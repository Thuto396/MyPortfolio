    <div id="Intro">
        <p>Greetings, fellow code warriors! Are you ready to join forces with a developer who knows how to slay software bugs and build epic applications? Look no further, because I'm your new development superhero!</p>
        <p>With my lightning-fast coding skills, my superhuman problem-solving abilities, and my unstoppable drive to create awesome software, I'm ready to take on any challenge that comes my way. Whether I'm hacking together a new feature or digging deep into a complex API, I always bring my A-game to the table.
        When I'm not busy crushing it in the development world, you can find me practicing my ninja moves, training for my next marathon, or getting lost in the latest science fiction novel. Oh, and did I mention that I make a mean cup of coffee? Because, let's face it, developers run on caffeine.
        So if you're looking for a developer who's equal parts superhero and super-geek, then look no further. I'm your guy (or gal)! Let's go build something amazing together!</p>

    <div id="About">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>As a recent graduate in systems development at just 21 years old, I'm eager to dive into the fast-paced world of software development and put my skills to the test. Throughout my studies, I developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, Kotlin and Dart, as well as a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software design principles.</p>
        <p>But more than just technical skills, I bring a fresh perspective to the industry, having grown up as a digital native and been exposed to technology from a young age. I'm excited to use this perspective to help create innovative solutions that meet the needs of users in new and creative ways.</p>
        <p>As I embark on my career in software development, I'm eager to continue learning and growing as a developer. I'm excited to work collaboratively with others to create high-quality, scalable, and maintainable code that makes a real difference in the world. So if you're looking for a motivated, curious, and dedicated developer to join your team, then look no further. I'm ready to hit the ground running!</p>
